# POC versioning Machine Learning pipeline

The aim of this repository is to show a way to handle **pipelining** and **versioning**
of a **Machine Learning project**.

Processes exposed during this tutorial are based of 3 existing tools:

 - [Data Science Version Control](https://github.com/iterative/dvc) or DVC
 - [MLflow tracking](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow)
 - [MLV-tools](https://github.com/peopledoc/ml-versioning-tools)
 
Use cases are based on a text classification task on 20newsgroup dataset. A *dummy* tutorial is also available
to show tools mechanisms.


**Requirements:**

Before starting, you must be familiar with the following commands: 
- virtualenv or condaenv
- make
- git
- python3


## Tools Overview

DVC: an open-source tool for data science and machine learning projects. Use to version, share and reproduce.

MLflow tracking: API and UI to log and visualize metrics obtained during experiments.

MLV-tools: provides a set of tools to enhance Jupyter Notebooks conversion and DVC versioning and pipelining.  


Please have a look to the [presentation](https://peopledoc.github.io/mlv-tools-tutorial/talks/pyData/presentation.html)


## Our main features

- Notebook parametrized conversion ([MLV-tools](https://github.com/peopledoc/ml-versioning-tools))

- Pipelining ([DVC](https://github.com/iterative/dvc) and [MLV-tools](https://github.com/peopledoc/ml-versioning-tools))

- Data x Code x Hyperparameters versioning ([DVC](https://github.com/iterative/dvc) and [MLV-tools](https://github.com/peopledoc/ml-versioning-tools))


## Standard Versioning Process Establishment

**Goal:** find a way to version code, data and pipelines.

#### Existing project

Starting from an existing project composed of Python 3 module(s) and a set of **Jupyter notebooks**,
we want to create an automated pipeline in order to version, share and reproduce experiments.

The data flow is processed by applying steps and intermediary results are versioned using metadata files. These steps are defined in **Jupyter notebooks**, which are then converted to Python scripts.

Keep in mind that:

 - The reference for the code of the step remains in **Jupyter notebook** 
 - Pipelines are structured according to their inputs and outputs
 - Hyperparameters are pipeline inputs

**Notebooks converted into configurable Python 3 scripts**: obtained by **Jupyter notebook** conversion.

**DVC pipeline steps**: DVC command applied on generated Python 3 scripts


#### Applying the process

For each **Jupyter notebook** a **Python 3** parameterizable and executable script is generated. It is the way to 
version code and be able to automatize its run.

Pipelines are composed of **DVC** steps. Those steps can be generated directly from the **Jupyter notebook** based
on parameters describe in the Docstring. (notebook -> python script -> DVC command)

Each time a **DVC** step is run a **DVC meta file** (`[normalize_notebook_name].dvc`) is created. This metadata
 file represent a pipeline step, it is the DVC result of a step execution. Those files must be tacked using Git.
They are used to reproduce a pipeline..

**Application:**
>For each step in the tutorial the process remain the same.
   
   1. Write a **Jupyter notebook** which correspond to a pipeline step. (See **Jupyter notebook** syntax section in 
   [MLVtools documentation](https://github.com/peopledoc/ml-versioning-tools))
   2. Test your **Jupyter notebook**.
   3. Add it under git.
   4. Convert the **Jupyter notebook** into a configurable and executable **Python 3** script using *ipynb_to_python*.
       
            ipynb_to_python -n ./pipeline/notebooks/[notebook_name] -o ./pipeline/steps/[python_script_name]
            
   5. Ensure **Python 3** executable and configurable script is well created into `./pipeline/steps/[python_script_name]`.
            
            ./pipeline/steps/[python_script_name] -h
    
   6. Create a **DVC** commands to run the **Python 3** script using **DVC**.
   
            gen_dvc -i ./pipeline/steps/[python_script_name] \
                        --out-dvc-cmd ./scripts/cmd/[dvc_cmd_name] 

   7. Ensure **DVC** command is well created.
   8. Add generated command and **Python 3** script under git.
   9. Add step inputs under **DVC**.
   10. Run **DVC** command `./scripts/cmd/[dvc_cmd_name]`.
   11. Check **DVC meta file** is created `./[normalize notebook _name].dvc`
   12. Add **DVC meta file** under git/
   

## Key Features
|Need| Feature|
|:---|:---|
| Ignore notebook cell | # No effect |
| DVC input and ouptuts | **:dvc-in**, **:dvc-out**|
| Add extra parameters | **:dvc-extra**|
| Write DVC whole command | **:dvc-cmd**|
| Convert Jupiter Notebook to Python 3 script | **ipynb_to_python**|
| Generate DVC command | **gen_dvc**|
| Create a pipeline step from a Jupiter Notebook | ipynb_to_python, gen_dvc |
| Add a pipeline step with different IO | Copy **DVC** step then edit inputs, outputs and meta file name |
| Reproduce a pipeline | **dvc repro [metafile]**|
| Reproduce a pipeline with no cache | **dvc repro -f [metafile]**|
| Reproduce a pipeline after an algo change | **dvc repro -f [metafile]** or run impacted step individually then complete the pipeline.|


It is allowed to modify or duplicate a **DVC** command to change an hyperparameter or run a same step twice with
different parameters.

It is a bad idea to modify generated **Python 3** scripts. They are generated from **Jupyter notebooks**, so changes 
should be done in them and then scripts should be re-generated.
